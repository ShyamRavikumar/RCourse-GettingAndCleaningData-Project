## Description of Variables
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.After a few transformations, design considerations, and filters, the following features were created.

tBodyAcc-XYZ

tGravityAcc-XYZ

tBodyAccJerk-XYZ

tBodyGyro-XYZ

tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ

tBodyAccMag

tGravityAccMag

tBodyAccJerkMag

tBodyGyroMag

tBodyGyroJerkMag

fBodyAcc-XYZ

fBodyAccJerk-XYZ

fBodyGyro-XYZ

fBodyAccMag

fBodyAccJerkMag

fBodyGyroMag

fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

## Working
The operations performed in the script are :
1)Read the training set, and the test set data, along with the activity and SubjectId columns for each set into 2 data tables. (Data.table for increased efficiency)
2)Create a new data table by binding the 2 sets by row
3)Identify the columns required(mean and std), and subset the table to include only those columns.
4)Apply the aggregate operation to perform the mean operation based on the factors SubjectID & Activity
5)Convert the Activity Factor into its readable format
6)Save the resulting table into a file

## Result
A Data Table with 180 obs. of  68 variables
